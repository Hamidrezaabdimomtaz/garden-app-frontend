# Garden App 

It is a project part of the LearnIT Coding & Finnish language training programme. This is where frontend team creates UI with Next.js.

## Building and running the project
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 
### Prerequisites
In order to be able to run and/or debug the project locally, you will have to install Node.js and Npm according to your operating system requirements:
https://nodejs.org/en/download

### Installing
Clone the project to your local machine by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:aseeva-es/garden-app-frontend.git
```
Clonning will automatically create the project directory for you, so go into it:
```bash
cd garden-app-frontend
```
Now let's install project dependencies with the command:
```bash
npm install
```
### Running
From inside the project directory, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Plain HTML/CSS/JS sandbox
We have setup the [`sandbox directory`](/public/sandbox/) for you to try your basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills without interfering with the main project work. Feel free to modify and delete/create new files in the directory and see what happens ðŸ˜ƒ! 
After running the local server, open http://localhost:3000/sandbox/plain.html with your browser to see the result.
